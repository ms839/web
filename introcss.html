            <div id="introduction">CSS is essential to making your website. CSS is how your customize and style your website.</div>
    <div id="introduction"> When using CSS, instead of using tags (<,>), it is a bit more complicated. For ID, you use hash (#),and for class, yeou use (.). You put them at the start of every css part, then you put somthing in front of it. For things like heading and body, you don't need to do (#) or (.) For example, for button, you do .button and for (#), for it to work, in HTML, you need to do <div class=""> and put what you want to edit in the quotation marks.
   <div id="explanation"> Since CSS is customization, you need it for a website unless you want a boring blank white website. </div>
