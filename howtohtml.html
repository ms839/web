    <div id="introduction">HTML is the backbone to most websites on the Internet. It is a Tag-Based coding language. That means you use tags, or <>, with different words inside of the greater-than less-than symbols that tells the website what kind of text should go into it. For instance, the < p > tag tells the website that the text inside of the opening and closing tag is a paragraph.</div>
    <div id="headings">This is a basic HTML document:<img src="Images/basichtml.png" align:"right"></div>
<div id="explanation">Basically, in the image, the !DOCTYPE html tag tells the document what coding language the document is in. In this case, it is in HTML. Notice that the headings and paragraphs have closing tags, which are tags with a slash in front of the tag's text. This is a closing tag. You need a closing tag to tell the document when to end the section and start a new one. Every beginning has an end!</div>
